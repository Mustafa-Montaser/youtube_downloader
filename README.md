# youtube_downloader
 python script for downloading videos from youtube with multiple qualities. 
 I used tkinter lib for GUI.
 you will find an extension file you can as it as a desktop app.
 
 ## how to use 
 1 - This app used to download single video or playlist so firstly should to choose type of download.
 
 2 - Copy link of the video and just click ***P*** button to paste link and searching for video.
 
 - *Note: if you want to download playlist, you need to copy the link for any video in that playlist not the playlist itself*.
 - ***C*** button is used to clear url box.
 
 3 - Then choose quality of the video and select directory
 
 ## linking to database
 When you run the app for first time it will create ***database*** file which used as a history for downloaded videos so, don't delete it.
 Each successfully download is stored in database and you can click ***history*** button to open history window
